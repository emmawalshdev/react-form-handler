This From Handler app was created as an introduction to React, Hooks, Components, Content API & Redux.

Upon first visiting the web app, the user is presented with a 'Login' page. Once logged in, the user has the ability to add user listings or logout.

While this app is not inteneded for realtime use, it demonstrats how React can be used to handle various processes & requiremnets.

I.e:
* Form validation
* Management of logged in/logged out states
* Web page redirects (using Routes)
* Resusuable components (Input fields, buttons, wrappers, navigation)
* Data handling (using lifting up state, props, useContext)
